description = "Tool for practicing events. Has a table of saved TP locations for each map. Type /toevent and you will teleport to the first event. Type it again you will go to the second and so on. Replaces boss triggers with sackrats so you don't have to delete all enemies and can get a more authentic event (the bosses are only replaced when you use the /toevent command so no issue having this mod on while playing the game). If you have issue with any of the tp locations go to the spot you think the tp should be and type /getLocationData. Also debug information about horde composition and pacing in the f4 menu

/startFOWAtWave <number (1-8)> - Start FOW at entered wave and will continue from there to end";
