description = "[h1]Main Path Progress[/h1]
The green spheres connected by the green lines are the 'Main Path'. The spheres are hard coded values defined in the games files. The purple sphere is your parties current progress along the main path. This includes all members of the party and bots. The purple line is drawn from your character to this sphere to help keep track of it. Multiple things in the game are determined by your progress along this path.

[h1]Bosses and Patrols[/h1]
Boss and patrol spawns are both triggered by reaching a certain progress along the main path. The map is divided into multiple zones and each of these zones have multiple possible triggers. When you load into a level, which triggers that will be used, if any, are decided. The red spheres on the main path are boss triggers and the orange ones are for patrol. When your progress crosses one of these triggers, if there is a boss or patrol loaded into that trigger it will spawn. To see where this event will spawn follow the bright green line to the much larger sphere of the same color.

[h1]Respawns[/h1]
Respawn locations are hardcoded. To spawn at a specific respawn location you must be greater than 70 units away from that unit. The way to read this is you take your position on the main path and proceed forward to the first cyan sphere and that will be the first respawn that will be used. 

The only exception to this is something called overrides. Overrides are used to stop you from spawning after an event.

In this example, you will see that my position skips the first respawn the first time. For the second respawn, you will see that my position skips the first two respawns.

[code]/where[/code] will draw your current respawn location taking overrides into account

[h1]Item Spawns[/h1]
Item spawns are kinda complicated and explaining how they work is outside the scope of explaining how to use the mod. If you would like to learn more about them you can read the [url=https://github.com/Aussiemon/Vermintide-2-Source-Code/blob/aee4049f019fa122c02497f6e87be3ad94f86053/scripts/entity_system/systems/pickups/pickup_system.lua#L355]source[/url]

Types of Item Spawners:
[list]
[*] Primary - Yellow
[*] Secondary - Orange
[*] Guaranteed - Red
[/list]

Primary/Secondary: In white above them you have the order of the spawn, of its respective type. Below that you will have a list of all the item that can spawn there. Before the name of each item there is a section number. Using both those facts and knowledge of how items spawns work you can get an idea about future spawn, based off what you have or have not seen spawn.

Guaranteed: Will only have a list of items that can spawn there, because it is just a random roll for one of the items in that list. There is no dependence on other spawns
